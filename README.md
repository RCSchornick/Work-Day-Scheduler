I have created a workday planner that will display a schedule for the current day. The calendar displays time blocks for standard business hours, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Once an event is added and saved to a time block, the event will be saved in local storage so that it continues to display after the page is refreshed.
